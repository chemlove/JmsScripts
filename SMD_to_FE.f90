! Description: This program uses the Jarzynski relationship to convert a collection of
! work data compiled from multiple steered molecular dynamics simulations into a free
! energy profile for the process.  I have a script that complements this program,
! compiling a single file in the format read by this program from raw data files generated
! by AMBER's SMD module.

program SMD_to_FE
implicit none

real, dimension(:), allocatable :: Work_array

real, parameter :: KB = 1.98722E-3
real :: TEMP, distance, BETA, work, holder
integer :: NUM_TRIALS
character (len=40) :: dataFile, outputFile
character (len=3) :: response
character (len=1) :: input_open
integer :: number_steps, i, c

! Work_array stores the values of work for each simulation: updated every new distance
! KB = Boltzmann's constant in kcal/mol*K (R, or gas constant)
! TEMP = system temperature, input by the user and checked for mistakes
! distance = the distance at which the Work values occur in the file
! NUM_TRIALS = number of trials, set to 100 is an upper limit, if more are needed this
!	       value can be changed and program recompiled
! dataFile = input name for the file containing the data
! outputFile = name of file created to store output
! response = yes/no response to queries
! input_open = indicator so that error message is not displayed before error is made
! number_steps = counter that keeps track of the number of steps written to jar.log by AMBER
! i, c = counters used in loops to keep track of indices
! BETA = stat-mech beta, 1/kT
! work = keeps track of exponential of work 
! holder = holding variable that holds a variable's value while it is changed

!==================================================================!

! Get the temperature and impose checks to make sure it was entered correctly, i.e. Kelvins
! and no obvious typos made
